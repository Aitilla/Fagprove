# Intro

Here I be using everything I have learned from being an apprentice at the University of Oslo to create a mini project for my fagprøve.
I have been an apprentice since Aug.14th/2023 and will end my time here by Aug.13th/2025
This project have been done between June.2nd/2025 - June.11th/2025

# Packages and tech

I will be using entur api for my ruter applications \* This is for public transport
// Link to be added

I will be using Supabase as my database provider \* This will be for authentication
// Link to be added

For testing I most likely be using Jest \* This is a well known testing library
// Link to be added

For encrypting/Hashing passwords and sessions I will be using bcrypt \* An easy way of encryption and comparing for validation
// Link to be added

# How to view my project.

1. Clone project
   I prefer cloning via ssh

2. Go to root folder of the project in your preferred terminal
    I prefer the integrated terminal in vscode

3. Write "npm i"

   This will install all required packages
4. If you have done the above and it is not working try "npm ci"

   "ci" stands for "clean install" this will reinstall all packages and remove possible duplicates
5. Create a ".env.local" file in the root directory

6. Copy my database URL and database public key
   You can find these at the bottom of readme-above sources

7. Write "npm run dev" to start a localhost which will run this project
   ^^^Make sure in root folder
