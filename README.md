# This is the repo for my fagprøve within It-development

# Intro

In this project I be using everything I have learned from being an apprentice at the University of Oslo to create a mini project for my fagprøve.
I have been an apprentice since Aug.14th/2023 and will end my time here by Aug.13th/2025
This project have been done between June.2nd/2025 - June.11th/2025

I will be using Supabase as my database provider 
   * This will be for authentication

For testing I most likely be using Jest 
   * This is a well known testing library

For encrypting/Hashing passwords and sessions I will be using bcrypt 
   * An easy way of encryption and comparing for validation

# How to view my project.

1. Clone project
   I prefer cloning via ssh

2. Go to root folder of the project in your preferred terminal
    I prefer the integrated terminal in vscode

3. Write "npm i"
   This will install all required packages

5. If you have done the above and it is not working try "npm ci"
   "ci" stands for "clean install" this will reinstall all packages and remove possible duplicates

6. Write "npm run dev" to start a localhost which will run this project
   ^^^Make sure in root folder
